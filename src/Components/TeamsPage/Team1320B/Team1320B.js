  overviewDesc: "1320B is a three person team that consist of juniors, who are involved in Tucker High School's STEM program. we divide the jobs among three people according to their skill sets and interests, in order to be a fully functioning and efficient team. Due to our small size we often help each other out with other tasks beside our own.Not only does this allow us to produce quality work but it also gives us an opportunity to be familiar with many different skills that could be useful for future purposes. Despite this we have a few disadvantages of being spread to thin and not getting enough work done. In order to solve this problem, we set deadlines before events, allowing us to get as much work possible before the competitions. If we meet these deadlines, we have enough time to complete all our work without rushing.",
